# The Circuit Less Travelled: A Path of Gentrification Through Colorado Neighborhoods

### Introduction
Large so-called superstar cities are often afflicted with gentrification due to an influx of new wealth moving into the city. For the Fall 2021 Data to Policy Symposium at the Auraria Library we analyze gentrification in the City of Denver over the last 15 years. One issue with studying gentrification is that snapshots of the distribution of wealth are only available on large time scales. This can make studying small changes difficult. To remedy this problem, we construct circuit walks between time-dependent clusterings of Denver neighborhoods for 3 different time instances.

### Resources
For this project, we pulled data on Denver neighborhoods from the American Community Surveys (ACS) for the City of Denver. The ACS contains a five year average of information collected about Denver including information about race, income, and education level.
