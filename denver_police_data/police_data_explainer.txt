Police Data

Police data sets contain police data for Denver by specified year. 
CSV contains date, lat/lon, x/y, stop type (pedestrian or vehicle), and neighborhood. 
There are also a few police specific columns, these should probably be filtered out. 

Each dataset contains around 100,000 rows and exactly 14 columns.

Project Ideas:

1. Cluster data by neighborhood, then we have a discrete time series of clusters with
number of assignments changing over time. This paints a picture of how reported crime 
has been changing over the last several years. 

Note: If we want to keep the number of elements the same in each year then we can take a
random sample of X number of rows from each line.
