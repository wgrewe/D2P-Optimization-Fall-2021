Project Ideas:
We can generate a lot of project ideas from this data set, the core method is in (1.)

1. Given a feature such as income level of a neighborhood, cluster neighborhoods by which ones
have a similar level of income, we could do this through kmeans. Then, we have 3 instances of 
different clusters of Denver's neighborhoods. Now, we can construct a circuit to understand
which neighborhoods are gentrifying significantly over the last 15 years. We can also use this 
to make predictions about which neighborhoods are likely to experience gentrification in the future.

Policy decisions for specific neighborhoods can then be extracted. For example, with anticipation that
a neighborhood may be at risk for experiencing gentrification, we can recommend building low-income housing nearby
or designing new policy to prevent tenants from being evicted.
