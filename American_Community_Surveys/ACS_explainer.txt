3 instances of the American Community Survey for the City of Denver

All surveys represent a 5 year average of data given at the neighborhood level

Years Included: 2006-2010, 2010-2014, 2015-2019

Each survey includes a lot of data points. 
Example columns:


Project Ideas:
We can generate a lot of project ideas from this data set, the core method is in (1.)

1. Given a feature such as income level of a neighborhood, cluster neighborhoods by which ones
have a similar level of income, we could do this through kmeans. Then, we have 3 instances of 
different clusters of Denver's neighborhoods. Now, we can construct a circuit to understand
which neighborhoods are gentrifying significantly over the last 15 years. We can also use this 
to make predictions about which neighborhoods are likely to experience gentrification in the future.

Policy decisions for specific neighborhoods can then be extracted. For example, with anticipation that
a neighborhood may be at risk for experiencing gentrification, we can recommend building low-income housing nearby
or designing new policy to prevent tenants from being evicted.

Pros: this dataset would be nice to cluster with lower and upper bounds on cluster size, too many items in a cluster
is nonsense, too few also isn't helpful. Forcing each cluster to be between 10-20 elements (For 78 neighborhoods) 
gives a nice interpretation of the clusters.

Cons: There are only 3 instances, so we cannot extract a lot of information.
