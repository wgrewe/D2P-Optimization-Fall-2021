Admission Data: HUGE AMOUNT FOR DATA, more than you wanted to know, more than what feels legal
Source: College Scorecard

Demographic Data: Fixed! but also too big to upload all avialable data to github. :( 

Project Ideas:
Cluster based on percent in stem majors
OR Cluster based on income brackets
OR Cluster on Pell Grant recipients
OR Cluster based on demographics by major

Pros: Many years of data set
A lot of possible variables to cluster on

Cons: Not a great visual representation
A lot of data cleaning to do :(
